# GrudgeBox
<b>NOTE!! This is a work in progress! The project will not build, let alone run, as yet</b>

A small utility for organizing and ranking all your grudges and grievances. Now you don't have to remember why you're 
annoyed with someone, because the tool remembers for you!

Grudge Box lets you store the names of entities (persons, places, or things) henceforth referred to as "subjects",
and then to create records of anything that said subjects have done to annoy you (henceforth referred to as "grudge
records"). Each grudge record consists of text containing details of the grievance, along with a severity (1-10,
with 10 being the highest), and a time stamp.

## Build

<pre>mvn compile</pre>
from a terminal in the project's root directory.

## Background/Trivia
This is just a goofy side project for me since it's been a while since I did anything with Hibernate/JPA or any Java 
UI development. I've been talking about the "grudge box" concept since at least 2013, and have been telling people
that their annoying actions have been earning them spots in my theoretical grudge box. After several years of talking
and joking, though, I was finally inspired in September 2018 to translate the grudge box concept from a mere idea into
an actual database and the software to interact with that database.

## Dedication
This project is dedicated to my very dear friend, who shall only be named here as #CB2, who inspired me to make the 
Grudge Box a reality.
